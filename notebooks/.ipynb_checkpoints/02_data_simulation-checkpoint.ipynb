    "### DATA COLLECTION AND SIMULATION FOR HPLC/GC QC ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In regulated analytical laboratories, quality control (QC) data are typically generated directly by chromatographic instrument software (HPLC or GC). These raw outputs are often proprietary, locked within vendor systems, or subject to confidentiality constraints. As a result, direct sharing or reuse of real QC datasets is frequently impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations while preserving analytical realism, this project employs a simulated chromatographic QC dataset designed to emulate real-world laboratory behavior. The simulated data enable controlled evaluation of precision, accuracy, variability, and trend detection, while ensuring reproducibility, auditability, and data privacy."
